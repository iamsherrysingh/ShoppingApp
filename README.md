##### ShoppingApp

I am creating a Shopping Application based on microservices architecute.
MicroServices planned are - Accounts MicroService, Product MicroService, Cart MicroService, Order MicroService, and a Shopping/FrontEnd MicroService

###### Technologies incorporated so far:
1. Spring Boot
2. Spring MVC
3. Spring Data JPA
4. Spring Cache
5. Spring Security


###### To implement:
1. JWT Access Tokens
2. Photo Upload


This project contains all the microservices seperated in packages with their own configuration, sql script, application launch class,and can deployed on different servers without much effort.
In the project's current state, these microservices can be spun up on 1 server at different ports.

# Spring ShoppingApp

I am creating a Shopping Application based on Microservices architecture.
MicroServices planned are - Accounts MicroService, Product MicroService, Cart MicroService, Order MicroService, and a Shopping/FrontEnd MicroService
I am focusing mostly on the APIs for the backend.

#### Technologies incorporated so far:
1. Spring Boot
2. Spring MVC
3. Spring Data JPA
4. Spring Cache
5. Spring Security


#### To implement:
1. JWT Access Tokens
2. Photo Upload


This project contains all the microservices separated in packages with their own configuration, sql scripts, application launch class,and can deployed on different servers without much effort.
In the project's current state, these microservices can be spun up on just 1 server but at different ports.
